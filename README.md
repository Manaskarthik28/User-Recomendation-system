# User-Recomendation-system
Build a user recommendation system using Neumf combination of neural network (MLP) architecture and GMF(matrix factorization)
Project overview and techniques
This project is a hybrid recommendation system that combines Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict user-item interactions. By leveraging both linear and non-linear patterns, the model aims to provide accurate, personalized recommendations for users.
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): is a deep neural network that learns complex, non-linear patterns through multiple layers. Combining MLP with Matrix Factorization (MF) enhances recommendations by capturing both simple, linear interactions (via MF) and more complex, non-linear relationships (via MLP). This hybrid approach, known as NeuMF, improves accuracy by leveraging both basic and advanced patterns in user-item data.
